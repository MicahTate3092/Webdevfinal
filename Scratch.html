    Rockets In the 2023-24 Season
        <p class="SummaryText">The 2023-24 season was a rebuilding year for the Houston Rockets as they continued to develop their young talent and integrate new acquisitions. Led by emerging star Jalen Green, the team showed flashes of potential throughout the season, but inconsistencies and inexperience led to a lower seed in the playoffs. Despite their struggles, the Rockets' young core gained valuable experience and demonstrated promising growth, laying a foundation for future success.</p>

            <p class="SummaryText">Looking ahead to the upcoming season, the Rockets are poised to make significant strides as their young players mature and gain more chemistry on the court. With another year of development under their belts and potentially key offseason acquisitions, the Rockets are expected to be more competitive and challenge for a higher playoff seed. While they may still be a work in progress, the trajectory of the team suggests a bright future ahead, with the potential to become a contender in the near future.</p>
